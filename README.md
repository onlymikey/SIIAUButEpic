# SIIAUButEpic
A web-based School Management System built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend. Software Enginnering Final Project

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following tools and versions installed on your system:

- **Bun**: Required for installing and running frontend dependencies.
- **Python 3.10** or higher: Needed to run the backend of the project.
- **Git**: Version control to clone the repository.
- **MySQL** or **MariaDB**: Required as the database for the backend.

> **Note**: Additional dependencies might be needed depending on your OS and development environment.

## Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/onlymikey/SIIAUButEpic.git
cd SIIAUButEpic
```

## Database Setup

1. **Create the database**:

   Open your MySQL or MariaDB client and create a new database called `siiau`:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE siiau;
   ```

2. **Configure database connection**:

   Make sure to update the database settings in the `settings.py` file to match your local MySQL or MariaDB configuration, including the database name, user, password, and host.

   The configuration file is located at:

   ```
   backend/SIIAUButEpic/settings.py
   ```

## Initialize the Backend

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

    ```
    cd backend
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (requires Python 3.10 or higher):

    ```
    python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

    - On **Windows**:

      ```
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - On **Linux**:

      ```
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Make migrations** (if necessary):

    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```

6. **Apply migrations** (make sure the database is active):

    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7. **Create an admin user**:

    ```
    python manage.py seed_admin
    ```

    This will create an admin with the following credentials:
    - **Username**: `admin`
    - **Password**: `securepassword`

8. **Start the backend server**:

    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Initialize the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

    ```
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```
    bun install
    ```

3. **Configure backend connection** (optional):

   If necessary, modify the backend server IP in the `api.js` file:

   ```
   frontend/src/services/api.js
   ```

4. **Start the frontend server**:

    ```
    bun run dev
    ```
